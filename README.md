# Auralis — 6D audio visualization

> *Real-time visualization of audio in a six-dimensional embedding space.*

Auralis turns each sound clip into a moving point in a six-dimensional
space and projects it onto a 3D canvas with **color** and **size**
encoding the remaining two dimensions. **Time** is the implicit sixth
axis: past frames stay visible with decreasing opacity, forming a fluid
trail that paints the structure of the sound.

[![Architecture](docs/svg/architecture.svg)](docs/architecture.md)

## Quickstart

```powershell
# Windows (Felipe's default)
.\scripts\local.ps1 seed     # generate synthetic seed clips + run pipeline
.\scripts\local.ps1 dev      # backend :8104 + Vite dev :5173
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux / Git Bash
./scripts/local.sh seed
./scripts/local.sh dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> in a browser. Pick a clip from the library
on the left, press play, and tweak the controls on the right.

## What is this?

A self-contained web app for **musicians, researchers and the
incurably curious**: drop in a sound, see what happens to it in
embedding space.

* **Six dimensions, your mapping.** The user picks which dimension
  drives X / Y / Z position, which drives color (4D), which drives
  sphere size (5D). Time is the implicit 6th axis (past frames fade
  out into a trail).
* **Nine render modes**, switchable from the control panel:
  * **Spheres** — discrete coloured spheres connected by a polyline.
  * **Smoke** — diffuse coloured clouds with additive blending and outward drift.
  * **Bursts** — each frame is a tiny explosion of coloured rays radiating from its centre.
  * **Constellation** — minimal star-map: tiny pulsing nodes joined by glowing edges.
  * **Aurora** — vertical curtains of light rising from each frame with a gentle sway.
  * **Comet** (default) — a bright glowing head at the cursor + a stretched fading tail.
  * **Tube** — a thick camera-aligned ribbon flowing along the trail.
  * **Galaxy** — permanent twinkling star-clusters at every frame; the whole 6D path stays visible.
  * **Flowfield** — a swarm of glowing particles advecting along the trail's tangent vectors.
* **Export** any frame as a PNG snapshot, or **record** the canvas as a webm video.
* **Five 6D embedding tracks**, all min-max normalized to `[0, 1]`:
  * **Features** — six interpretable spectral scalars.
  * **PCA / t-SNE / UMAP** — corpus-wide projections of MFCC frames.
  * **Tonnetz** — natural 6D harmonic space (Harte et al. 2006), with
    axes encoding fifths, minor thirds and major thirds.
  * **YAMNet** — 1024-D deep AudioSet embeddings (Hershey et al.
    2017) projected to 6D via PCA.
* **Live spectrogram + waveform side panels.** Wired up via the Web
  Audio API and colored with the active colormap.
* **Seven perceptually-uniform colormaps.** viridis, magma, plasma,
  inferno, cividis, turbo, RdBu (diverging).
* **Bilingual UI from day one.** Spanish (default) + English with a
  visible switcher; preference persists across reloads.
* **Light + dark themes**, also persistent.
* **~70 ready-to-play clips** out of the box, organised in a
  collapsible tree by category and subcategory (synthetic, birds,
  mammals, amphibians/reptiles, insects, nature, speeches, music,
  space, mechanical). Each clip ships with verified license metadata
  and per-clip credits.
* **Snapshot export** — one button to grab the current 6D viz as a PNG.

## Local development

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts\local.ps1 dev` / `scripts/local.sh dev` | Backend on :8104 + Vite dev on :5173 (proxied) |
| `scripts\local.ps1 seed` | Generate synthetic clips + run full pipeline |
| `scripts\local.ps1 ingest` | Re-run pipeline (manifest + embeddings) |
| `scripts\local.ps1 build` | Build the production frontend bundle |
| `scripts\local.ps1 preview` | Build + serve the SPA via FastAPI |
| `scripts\local.ps1 clean` | Remove build outputs |
| `scripts\local.ps1 stop` | Kill local dev processes |

## Adding more clips

```powershell
# Pull the curated library defined in data-pipeline/curated_downloads.py
.\.venv-pipeline\Scripts\python.exe data-pipeline\curated_downloads.py --download

# Or drop your own files into data/sounds/<category>/<id>.<ext>
# (with optional <id>.meta.json sidecar carrying title + license)

# Then regenerate the manifest + embeddings
.\scripts\local.ps1 ingest
```

Each individual audio file must stay below 80 MB (GitHub's per-file
recommendation). The pipeline accepts `.ogg`, `.oga`, `.opus`,
`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.m4a`.

## Deployment

Production runs on Felipe's Hetzner VPS at
<https://auralis.fasl-work.com> on port 8104. Templates live under
[`deploy/`](deploy/); the operational binding (host + domain + port)
is documented in the private CAOS_MANAGE repo at
`deployments/auralis.md`.

```bash
# On the VPS, as root:
bash /opt/fasl-apps/CAOS_6D_Sounds/deploy/setup.sh   # first-time setup
bash /opt/fasl-apps/CAOS_6D_Sounds/deploy/update.sh  # subsequent redeploys
```

license.
